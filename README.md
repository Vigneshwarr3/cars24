# Introduction
Cars24 is a leading AutoTech company focused on the sale, purchase, and financing of pre-owned cars.  

The company offers an online marketplace for buying and selling used cars, complemented by a suite of services including car financing, quality checks, warranties, and seamless documentation for transactions.  

Cars24 primarily serves the automotive industry with a customer base looking for pre-owned vehicle solutions.  

# Problem Statement
The main idea I had behind using this dataset was to try and find some way to predict the selling price of a used car based on brand, model, age, no of previous owners, fuel type, kilometers driven and transmission type.  

Consider a scenario like while adding a new record of a used car data, someone should make an assessment of the car and figure out what the selling price should be.  

The goal of this project is to automate this task using linear regression.
